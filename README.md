# cs340-final-project
This website is my final group project for Intro to Databases in collaboration with my partner.

Instructions:
1. Clone repository
2. In the terminal, cd into the root directory
3. Install express - Mac users you can use "npm i express"
4. Start the server with "node app.js"
5. Open your browser to see the website

NOTE: This is only to showcase my project. Since it is not connected to an actual database, clickable
events involved with the db do not work.
