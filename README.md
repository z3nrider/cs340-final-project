# Team-Meme-Stock
This is the general file location for the TD Memetrade Project

You can see the website design locally by following these instructions:
1. Download the repo
2. In the terminal, cd into the root directory of this project
3. Install express; Mac users you can use "npm i express"
4. Start the server with the command "node app.js"
5. Open your browser to http://localhost:42086/

Note: Clickable events dealing with server operations won't work.
I plan to update the website to connect to a server in the future.
